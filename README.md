# WeatherPython
Visualization of the weather of more than five hundred cities across the world of varying distance from the equator

The question : 
What's the weather like as we approach the equator?

Technologies used :
-Python library : citipy 0.0.5
-OpenWeatherMap API

Scatter plots showing the relationship between :

-Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
-Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
-Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
-Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

linear regression of each relationship, seperated into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

-Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
-Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
-Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
-Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
-Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
-Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
-Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
-Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
